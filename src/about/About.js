            <p>
                Hello visitor, I am a Jr. Software engineer at Tide@l. Responsible for creating, design and maintaining the visual part of the projects, I try
                to ever do my best in addition to sharing new ideas with the team.  
            </p>
            <p>
                We are currently working on componentizing the project and maintaining a pattern when it comes to the macro, it's a hard work, but it's worth both for the project and for our development.
                my main stack is Vue.js, Sass, Cypress for testing, but I can work with another tools, like typescript, Bootstrap. I am aware of git and gitflow too.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can learn new technologies and adapt quickly, I can find answers to problems on my own and always try to deliver the best code.
            </p>
